# Your Movies

## About the project

- This web app is a movie website that includes a movie database which the users can view.
- The app has user authentication using Identity, registered and logged in users can additionally have their own table for favourite movies of their choice and view their account details.
- There is also authorization based on Admin role, the administrator has all the standard user functions and can as well add, edit and delete movies from the database (CRUD operations).
  **I have used the MVC software design pattern for this project.**
  **The database has been created with a code-first approach using Entity Framework Core**

**Note:** The database is seeded with a couple of movies and an admin account for demo purposes. (Admin email: admin@admin.com password: admin123)
